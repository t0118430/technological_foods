  Title: Reorganize backend/api/ into domain subfolders

  Body:

  Summary

  Restructures the flat 38-file backend/api/ directory into 9    
  domain subfolders for better navigability and separation of    
  concerns. server.py stays at the root as the orchestrator.     

  New structure

  backend/api/
  ├── server.py                       # Orchestrator (stays at   
  root)
  ├── db/                             # database.py,
  pg_database.py
  ├── etl/                            # influx_pg_etl.py,

  rules_config.json
  └── tests/                          # 8 test_*.py files        

  What changed

  - 32 files moved into domain subfolders (git mv for blame      
  preservation)
  - 9 __init__.py files with re-exports for clean package imports
   (e.g. from db import db, from notifications import notifier)  
  - All Path(__file__) references updated for +1 directory depth 
  - All imports updated: server.py, cross-package, within-package
   (relative), test files, @patch() targets, standalone scripts  
  - No functional changes — pure structural refactor

  Why

  The flat directory had 38 files making it hard to navigate.    
  Domain subfolders group related modules, make dependencies     
  visible at the folder level, and follow standard Python package
   conventions.

  Test plan

  - All 181 tests pass (pytest tests/ -x)
  - Syntax check on all Python files (ast.parse)
  - Manual: start server, verify /api/health
