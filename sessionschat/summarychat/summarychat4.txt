Session Summary
Problem: Your Arduino sketch (temp_hum_light_sending_api.ino) failed to compile due to missing #include directives — Wire and Environment_I2C were undeclared.

Resolution: You updated the sketch significantly:

Replaced Arduino_SensorKit / Environment_I2C with the DHT20 library (<DHT20.h>)
Added <Wire.h> for I2C
Added simulated sensors (pH, EC, water level, light level) using a random-walk drift function
Expanded sendToAPI() to send all 6 fields including sensor_id
Added a light sensor pin definition and RNG seeding
The sketch now reads real temp/humidity from the DHT20 and simulates the remaining hydroponic sensor values.

Action Points
Install the DHT20 library — Make sure it's installed in Arduino IDE (Library Manager → search "DHT20" by Rob Tillaart)
Verify compilation — Re-compile the updated sketch to confirm the errors are resolved
Backend alignment — Your API endpoint (POST /api/data) now receives additional fields (ph, ec, water_level, light_level, sensor_id). Check that backend/api/server.py handles these new fields
Replace simulated sensors — When you have real pH, EC, and water level sensors, swap out the drift() simulation with actual hardware reads
Light sensor — Pin A0 is defined for a physical light sensor but currently unused (simulated instead). Wire up an LDR if you want real readings
