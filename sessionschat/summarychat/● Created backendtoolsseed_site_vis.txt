● Created backend/tools/seed_site_visits.py. Here's what it does:               
  5 demo clients — Dutch hydroponic companies with realistic names, tiers    
  (bronze/silver/gold), locations, health scores, and contact details.
  Skipped if the clients table already has data.                                                                                                          
  35 demo site visits spread over the last ~4 months with:
  - 4 inspectors rotating across visits
  - Weighted visit types (50% routine, 25% follow-up, 15% audit, 10%
  emergency)
  - Random zones, crop batches, and sensor snapshots per visit
  - Realistic observations, actions, and issues (with severity + category)   
  - ~30% have follow-ups (some already completed)
  - Rating distribution weighted toward 4-5 stars
  - If visits already exist, prompts before clearing

  Run it:
  cd backend/api
  python ../tools/seed_site_visits.py
