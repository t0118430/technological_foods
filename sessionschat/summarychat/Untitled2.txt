  Complete technical analysis with:
  - 🔴 9 Critical Issues - System fails at 50+ sensors
  - 🟠 3 High Priority Issues - Performance degradation
  - 🟡 2 Medium Priority Issues - Operational overhead
  - Specific code examples showing problems and fixes
  - Performance benchmarks (current vs. target)

  Key Finding: Current architecture supports 5-10 sensors. Needs 50x capacity increase.

  2. SCALABILITY_BACKLOG.md (Product Backlog)

  Complete sprint-ready backlog with:
  - 4 Epics (major initiatives)
  - 12 User Stories (business value perspective)
  - 40+ Technical Tasks (implementation details)
  - Acceptance criteria for each story
  - Dependencies mapped
  - 3-week timeline with daily breakdown

  Sprint Breakdown:
  - Week 1: Async infrastructure (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, rate limiting)
  - Week 2: Background processing (Celery, caching, database optimization)
  - Week 3: Production hardening (monitoring, security, automation)

  3. GITHUB_ISSUES_TEMPLATE.md (Ready to Import)

  Copy-paste ready GitHub issues:
  - 4 Epic issues with full descriptions
  - 8 User story issues with:
    - Acceptance criteria (checkboxes)
    - Technical task breakdowns
    - Code examples
    - Dependencies
    - Risk mitigation
  - Labels to create (P0-critical, story-points-X, etc.)
  - Milestone setup commands

  Quick Start:
  # Create issue with GitHub CLI
  gh issue create --title "Migrate to FastAPI Framework" \
    --body-file issue_5.md \
    --label "P0-critical,story-points-8"

  4. EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (Stakeholder Communication)

  Business-focused document with:
  - Current vs. Target capacity comparison
  - ROI Analysis: $25K investment → $450K/year revenue
  - Payback period: <3 weeks
  - Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
  - Decision matrix (approve/delay/reject)
  - 3-week timeline with milestones

  Bottom Line: Cannot scale beyond 10 clients without refactoring. 3-week project unblocks enterprise growth.

  Critical Blockers

  1. Synchronous architecture - everything blocks
  2. No connection pooling - database deadlocks
  3. No task queue - notifications block responses
  4. No rate limiting - vulnerable to DDoS
  5. Missing indexes - queries slow exponentially

  3-Week Fix

  - Week 1: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Rate Limiting → 10x throughput
  - Week 2: Celery + Caching → 100x faster responses
  - Week 3: Monitoring + Security → Enterprise-ready

  📋 Next Steps - Choose Your Path

  Option A: Create GitHub Issues (Recommended)

  # Setup labels and milestones
  gh label create "P0-critical" --color "d93f0b"
  gh label create "story-points-8" --color "c5def5"

  # Create issues from templates
  gh issue create --title "[EPIC] Async Infrastructure Foundation" \
    --body-file epic_1.md \
    --label "epic,P0-critical" \
    --milestone "Sprint 1"

  Option B: Review Documents First

  1. Read EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md for business context
  2. Review SCALABILITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md for technical details
  3. Check SCALABILITY_BACKLOG.md for implementation plan
  4. Use GITHUB_ISSUES_TEMPLATE.md to create issues

  Option C: Start Implementing

  Jump straight to Week 1, Day 1:
  - Install FastAPI: pip install fastapi[all] uvicorn
  - Follow Task 1.1.1 in SCALABILITY_BACKLOG.md
