  What We Did                                                       
  
  We executed a 4-phase documentation reorganization plan for the     AgriTech NFT Hydroponics platform:                                

  Phase 1 — Archive cleanup: Moved 3 stale session files
  (comprehensive_project_report.txt, deep_search.md,
  new_session_prompt.md) into archived/docs/sessionschat/ and       
  deleted the root sessionschat/ directory entirely.

  Phase 2 — Root README.md: Replaced the 1-line stub ("readme na    
  pasta backend/") with a 176-line product-owner-friendly README    
  covering architecture, capabilities, quick start, API overview    
  across 17 domains, documentation index, all 15 Grafana dashboards,
   and the full tech stack.

  Phase 3 — User Guide: Created docs/USER_GUIDE.md (~900 lines) — a 
  comprehensive guide with 15 sections targeting product owners and 
  operators. Includes daily checklists, curl examples for every     
  operation, sensor range tables, troubleshooting matrices, and a   
  complete API quick reference of 80+ endpoints.

  Phase 4 — Dashboard Help API: Created backend/api/static/help.json
   (structured JSON with 11 categories, 8 quick tips, 10 doc links) 
  and wired it into server.py as a public GET /api/help endpoint.   

  All verifications passed: valid JSON, valid Python, all internal  
  links resolve, sessionschat/ gone.

  Propositions

  1. Frontend Help Panel

  The help.json is ready but has no consumer yet. Build a
  lightweight help sidebar or modal in the existing HTML dashboards 
  (dashboard.html, site_visits.html) that fetches /api/help and     
  renders searchable, categorized help cards. Low effort, high      
  visibility for operators.

  2. Onboarding Wizard / First-Run Detection

  The quick start is documented but manual. Add a /api/status/setup 
  endpoint that checks: are Docker services reachable? Is InfluxDB  
  receiving data? Are any crops registered? Are notification        
  channels configured? This could power a "setup checklist" in the  
  UI and helps the product owner know what's missing.

  3. Interactive Swagger Examples

  The Swagger UI exists but lacks request body examples for complex 
  endpoints (crops, rules, harvester imports). Enrich openapi.json  
  with example fields pulled from the User Guide curl snippets. This
   turns Swagger from "documentation" into a usable testing tool.   

  4. Automated Link / Doc Freshness Check

  We verified links manually today. Add a CI step (GitHub Action)   
  that parses all .md files, extracts internal links, and fails if  
  any point to non-existent files. Prevents documentation rot as the
   codebase evolves.

  5. Localization (Portuguese)

  The product owner and local operators are in the Algarve. Consider
   a docs/USER_GUIDE_PT.md translation of the key sections (daily   
  operations, troubleshooting, crop management). The help.json      
  structure already supports adding a "locale" field per category   
  for future i18n.

  6. PDF Export of User Guide

  Product owners often want printable docs. A GitHub Action that    
  runs pandoc docs/USER_GUIDE.md -o USER_GUIDE.pdf on each release  
  would auto-generate a downloadable PDF. Minimal effort, useful for
   site visits without laptop access.

  7. Consolidate Legacy docs/guides/USER_MANUAL.md

  The old USER_MANUAL.md (800 lines) still exists alongside the new 
  USER_GUIDE.md. Some content overlaps, some is unique (Raspberry Pi
   setup, ntfy mobile details). Options: merge the unique parts into
   the User Guide and archive the old file, or add a deprecation    
  notice pointing to the new guide.
