  What We Built

  An ESP32 WROOM sensor station for your agritech project, reading real sensors and sending data to an API.                           
  Problems Solved

  1. DHT22 wires swapped — VCC and DATA were reversed on the sensor side
  2. GPIO25 (DAC pin) — doesn't work for DHT protocol, moved to GPIO33
  3. Adafruit DHT library — timing issues on ESP32, switched to DHTesp
  4. DS18B20 x2 burned — bare wires touched each other without plastic connectors
  5. LED burned — connected directly to 5V without resistor
  6. ESP32 "dead" scare — just needed all wires removed, board was fine
  7. EN pin needs 3.3V — something on breadboard pulling it low
  8. Baud rate 115200 missing — switched to 9600

  What's Working

  - DHT22 reading 18°C / 68% humidity
  - Water level sensor detecting water (0/1)
  - LED indicating status
  - WiFi connected to your network
  - API code ready (needs backend running)

  What's Simulated (Still Fake)

  - pH, EC, light level (random drift values)

  Propositions

  Immediate (This Week)

  1. Wire the TDS sensor on GPIO34 — replaces simulated EC with real data
  2. Fix the EN pin issue — check what's pulling it low on the breadboard so you don't need the 3.3V jumper
  3. Start the backend API — everything is ready to send data to 192.168.1.100:3001

  Short Term (Parts Needed)

  4. Replace DS18B20 (~$3) — get water temperature working with proper connectors this time
  5. Replace LED (~$1) — or use the built-in one on GPIO2 for now
  6. Get a screw terminal board (~$6) — eliminates breadboard connection issues
  7. Add a light sensor (LDR) on GPIO35 — replaces simulated light level, ~$1

  Medium Term

  8. Add a real pH sensor — replaces the last simulated value (~$15-30)
  9. Merge ESP32 code into the technological_foods repo — keep everything in one place
  10. Set up the backend on your Raspberry Pi — run the API server 24/7
  11. Add OTA (Over The Air) updates — update ESP32 code via WiFi instead of USB

  Hardware Safety Rules Going Forward

  - Always wire with USB unplugged
  - Use plastic connectors, never bare wires on breadboard
  - Resistor with every LED (220-330Ω)
  - Pull-up resistor with every DS18B20 (4.7kΩ) — wire it BEFORE powering on
  - One new component at a time — test each before adding the next
