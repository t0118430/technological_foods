Here's a summary of everything done in this conversation:

Summary
1. API Security — Credentials & Authentication
Problem: WiFi credentials and server IP were hardcoded in the Arduino sketch. No authentication on any API endpoint.

Done:

Created config.h.example — template with WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS, API_HOST, API_PORT, API_KEY
Updated .ino sketch — uses #include "config.h", sends X-API-Key header on every request
Updated server.py — validates X-API-Key on all endpoints (except /api/health)
Updated .gitignore — config.h never reaches the repo
2. Notification Service — Channel-Agnostic Alerts
Problem: No way to get alerted when sensor values go out of range.

Done:

Created notification_service.py — NotificationChannel ABC interface with 4 concrete channels (Console, WhatsApp stub, SMS stub, Email stub)
NotificationService orchestrator with per-rule cooldown (15 min default) to prevent spam
New action type "notify" in the rule engine alongside "ac" and "arduino"
Two new endpoints: POST /api/notifications/test and GET /api/notifications
3. Hydroponic Alert Rules
Done: Added 9 production-relevant rules to rules_config.json:

Sensor	Low threshold	High threshold
Temperature	< 15°C	> 30°C
Humidity	< 40%	> 80%
pH	< 5.5	> 7.0
EC	< 0.8 mS/cm	> 2.5 mS/cm
Water level	< 20%	—
4. Postman Collection
Updated AgriTech_API.postman_collection.json with all endpoints, X-API-Key auth at collection level, and ready-to-use requests to trigger alerts and change thresholds.

5. Tests & README
Created test_notification_service.py — 21 tests (channels, cooldown, history, rule integration)
All 46 tests pass (25 existing + 21 new)
Updated README.md with auth, notification, and hydroponic alert documentation
Actions still needed from you
Create your config.h — copy config.h.example, fill in your real WiFi credentials and API key
Add API_KEY to your backend/.env — must match the key in config.h
Flash the updated sketch to your Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
Import the updated Postman collection and test with "Send Sensor Data (trigger alerts)"
When ready for real alerts — fill in Twilio or SMTP credentials in .env, the channels auto-activate
I also see you've since evolved the codebase significantly (ntfy channel, escalation manager, growth stages, drift detection, business dashboard, Swagger UI). Those were done outside this conversation but are already integrated.
