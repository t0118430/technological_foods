  You are working on the AgriTech Technological Foods project (hydroponic
   monitoring platform).
  Repository: git@github.com:t0118430/technological_foods.git
  Main branch: master

  ## YOUR MISSION

  Read the file `sessionschat/project_analysis_report.txt` — it contains 
  a full project analysis with prioritized action items (Section 5: "What
   to Prioritize Next"). Your job is to **implement each solution point  
  as a separate branch + Pull Request**, iterating through them one by   
  one.

  ## THE ACTION ITEMS (from the report, Section 5)

  1. **Rotate compromised credentials** — Remove/clean `technological    
  food.txt` if it exists, remove hardcoded credentials from
  `arduino/config.h` (use `config.h.example` with placeholders instead), 
  ensure `.gitignore` properly excludes secrets, and add a `SECURITY.md` 
  with instructions on credential management.

  2. **Add tests for untested business modules** — Write dedicated test  
  files for:
     - `backend/api/business_model.py` →
  `backend/api/test_business_model.py`
     - `backend/api/client_manager.py` →
  `backend/api/test_client_manager.py`
     - `backend/api/drift_detection_service.py` →
  `backend/api/test_drift_detection.py`
     - `backend/api/business_dashboard.py` →
  `backend/api/test_business_dashboard.py`
     Each should have meaningful unit tests covering core logic. Run     
  `python -m pytest backend/api/ -v` to verify all tests pass.

  3. **Document the simulated-to-real sensor transition plan** — Create  
  `docs/sensor_transition_plan.md` explaining: which sensors are
  currently simulated (pH, EC, water_level, light_level), the interface  
  contract each real sensor must fulfill, wiring/calibration notes for   
  common probes (Atlas Scientific pH/EC, HC-SR04 ultrasonic for water    
  level), and how to swap simulation code in `arduino_http_client.ino`   
  for real readings.

  4. **Clean up sessionschat duplicates** — Audit
  `sessionschat/summarychat/` for duplicate files (the report identifies 
  specific duplicates). Consolidate into a single chronological session  
  log or clearly named non-overlapping files. Remove exact duplicates.   

  5. **Wire snapshot notification to filter by sensor_id/zone** — In the 
  notification/snapshot endpoint, when a `crop_id` is provided, query    
  InfluxDB filtering by `sensor_id` or `zone` tag associated with that   
  crop (via `growth_stage_manager` or `client_manager` mappings) instead 
  of returning the global latest reading. This enables multi-zone        
  deployments.

  ## WORKFLOW FOR EACH ITEM

  For each action item above, do the following **sequentially**:

  1. `git checkout master && git pull origin master`
  2. `git checkout -b fix/report-item-N-short-description` (e.g.,        
  `fix/report-item-1-credential-rotation`)
  3. Implement the changes thoroughly
  4. Run tests: `python -m pytest backend/api/ -v` — ensure all pass     
  5. Commit with a clear message describing what was done and why        
  6. `git push -u origin HEAD`
  7. Create a PR to `master` using `gh pr create --title "..." --body    
  "..."` with:
     - A clear title referencing the report item number
     - Body with ## Summary, ## Changes, ## Test plan sections
     - Reference: "From project_analysis_report.txt, Priority Item N"    
  8. Move to the next item

  ## IMPORTANT RULES

  - Do NOT skip items — implement all 5 in order
  - Do NOT combine multiple items into one PR — each gets its own branch 
  and PR
  - Run tests after each change to ensure nothing breaks
  - If an item requires reading existing code first, READ the relevant   
  files before modifying
  - Keep existing functionality intact — these are improvements, not     
  rewrites
  - For Item 1 (credentials): do NOT commit any actual secrets. Use      
  placeholders like `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
  - For Item 2 (tests): read the source modules first to understand what 
  to test

  ## WHEN DONE

  After all 5 PRs are created:
  1. Send a notification via the project's own ntfy channel: `curl -d    
  "All 5 report items implemented as PRs. Ready for review."
  ntfy.sh/technological-foods-alerts`
  2. List all created PRs with `gh pr list`
  3. Print a summary of what was done
  4. **STOP PROCESSING** — do not continue with any other tasks

  ---
  This prompt will make the other Claude instance:
  - Read the analysis report for context
  - Create 5 separate branches + PRs, one per priority item
  - Run tests after each to ensure nothing breaks
  - Ping via ntfy (the project's own notification system) when all 5 are 
  done
  - Print a summary and stop
