# 🚀 Action Plan: Technological Foods Pilot Project

**Vision**: Launch Portugal's first water-recycling organic farm cooperative in Trás-os-Montes
**Timeline**: 6 months to first harvest
**Budget**: €150,000 (70% EU-funded)
**Impact**: 10 farmers, 2 hectares, 50,000L/month recycled water

---

## 📍 Pilot Location: Bragança, Portugal

### Why Bragança?

**Challenges (Perfect for Pilot)**:
- 🏚️ Severe rural depopulation (-30% since 2000)
- 💧 Summer water scarcity
- 👴 Aging farmers (average age: 65)
- 📉 Youth unemployment (15-24 age group)
- 🌾 Abandoned agricultural land

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Águas do Nordeste (local water company) - potential partner
- ✅ Instituto Politécnico de Bragança (IPB) - research support
- ✅ Municipal government supportive of innovation
- ✅ Available land (municipal/abandoned farms)
- ✅ Close to Spanish border (export opportunity)
- ✅ NUTS2 region = eligible for maximum EU funding

**Existing Infrastructure**:
- ETAR (wastewater treatment) capacity: 40,000 m³/day
- Current use: 60% (16,000 m³/day excess capacity)
- **Opportunity**: Use 10% of excess = 1,600 m³/day for agriculture!
