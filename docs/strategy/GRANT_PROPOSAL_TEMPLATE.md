# Grant Proposal: Technological Foods for Remote Communities
**Organization**: Technological Foods
**Project Title**: Solar-Powered IoT Hydroponics for Food Security in Remote Communities
**Funding Requested**: $10,000 (Pilot Phase)
**Duration**: 6 months
**Date**: 2026-02-09

---

## Executive Summary

We propose to deploy **solar-powered, offline-first hydroponic systems** in 3 remote communities, providing sustainable food production, economic opportunity, and technology education. Each system costs $600, produces $2,000+ in annual value, and operates completely off-grid with no internet dependency.

**Impact**: 300 people gain access to fresh vegetables, 6 full-time jobs created, 1,500 kg of food produced in first 6 months.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

**800 million people** worldwide face hunger, with rural and remote communities disproportionately affected by:
- ✗ Climate change disrupting traditional agriculture
- ✗ Water scarcity limiting crop production
- ✗ Limited access to fresh vegetables (nutrition gap)
- ✗ Economic opportunities concentrated in urban areas
- ✗ Unreliable power and internet infrastructure

### Current Situation in Target Communities

[INSERT SPECIFIC COMMUNITY DATA]

**Example**:
- Location: [Rural District Name], [Country]
- Population: 100 households (~500 people)
- Current food access: Limited to seasonal crops, 50km to nearest market
- Average income: <$2/day per person
- Infrastructure: No grid electricity, intermittent cellular coverage
- Water: Seasonal rainfall, 2km walk to nearest well

**Nutritional Gap**: Only 15% of households consume fresh vegetables weekly.

---

## Proposed Solution

### Technology Overview

**Solar-powered hydroponic system** with IoT monitoring that:
- ✅ Operates 100% off-grid (solar powered)
- ✅ Works offline-first (no internet required)
- ✅ Uses 90% less water than traditional farming
- ✅ Produces food year-round (not seasonal)
- ✅ Provides real-time alerts via SMS (no smartphone needed)
- ✅ Costs $600 (6-month ROI)

```

### Why This Approach?

1. **Offline-First**: System stores all data locally, syncs when connectivity available
2. **Solar-Powered**: No grid electricity needed, works in most remote areas
3. **SMS Alerts**: Works with basic phones (no smartphone/app required)
4. **Community-Owned**: Local assembly, maintenance, and operation
5. **Economically Sustainable**: Pays for itself in 4-6 months
