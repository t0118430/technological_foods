Conversation Summary
1. Integration Tests & Kubernetes Assessment (previous turn)
You asked two questions:

"Do we have integration tests running on the pipeline?" — Yes, they existed in test-backend.yml but failures were silently ignored (|| echo "⚠️ failed"). I fixed this so tests now block the pipeline on failure, added a server startup step, and upgraded upload-artifact from v3 to v4.
"Would Kubernetes help?" — No. At your scale (100-200 sensors, 50 clients), Kubernetes is overkill (~3x the cost, 10x the complexity). Docker Compose is the right fit. I created comparison docs explaining when K8s would make sense (1000+ sensors, multi-region).
2. Remote Community Vision (previous turn)
You shared your vision of deploying this technology to remote communities. I created:

VISION_REMOTE_COMMUNITY_DEPLOYMENT.md — Full deployment blueprint (offline-first, solar-powered, SMS dashboard)
GRANT_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md — Ready-to-submit $10K pilot funding proposal
BUILD_YOUR_FIRST_600_PROTOTYPE.md — Step-by-step hardware build guide
3. Organize All .md Files (current task - in progress)
You pointed out that the scattered .md files in root wouldn't pass inspection. I started organizing:

Completed so far:

Created subdirectory structure: docs/strategy/, docs/architecture/, docs/planning/, docs/reviews/, docs/devops/, docs/github/, docs/guides/
Moved GitHub issue docs → docs/github/
Moved loose scripts → tools/
Moved untracked docs into proper subcategories (planning/, devops/, strategy/)
Still in progress:

Some tracked docs/ files still need git mv into subcategories (e.g., BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.md → docs/architecture/, USER_MANUAL.md → docs/guides/)
Cross-reference links between docs need updating
Final verification
