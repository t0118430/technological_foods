## 🌱 **Crop Selection Strategy - BUSINESS FIRST**

### **Decision Framework**

Each crop evaluated on:
1. **LOCAL market demand** (will Algarve buyers pay premium?)
2. **Heat tolerance** (Algarve = 15-35°C, use it!)
3. **Premium positioning** (can you charge 2-3x supermarket price?)
4. **Growth speed** (cash flow = survival)
5. **Shelf life** (minimize waste)
6. **Restaurant appeal** (chefs = highest margins)

**NOT evaluated on:**
- ❌ Global trends
- ❌ Industrial scalability
- ❌ Long-distance shipping
- ❌ Mass market appeal

## 🌡️ **Climate Optimization - Algarve Weather**

### **Algarve Temperature Patterns**

| Season | Outside Temp | Greenhouse Temp | Best Crops |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Winter** (Dec-Feb) | 8-18°C | 12-22°C | Rosso lettuce, arugula |
| **Spring** (Mar-May) | 15-25°C | 18-28°C | ALL crops thrive |
| **Summer** (Jun-Aug) | 22-35°C | 25-38°C | Basil, tomatoes, mint |
| **Autumn** (Sep-Nov) | 15-28°C | 18-30°C | Lettuce, herbs |

**Key Insights:**
- **Winter:** Use heat from crops + passive solar (no heating needed above 12°C)
- **Summer:** Shade cloth + ventilation (Algarve heat = FREE for basil/tomatoes)
- **Year-round:** Rosso lettuce + arugula = consistent cash flow
- **Peak profits:** May-September (tourist season + perfect weather)

**Outside Weather Monitoring (NEW!):**
- Track outside temp, humidity, wind
- **When outside = optimal:** Open greenhouse, save energy
- **When outside = too hot:** Close + shade cloth
- **When outside = rain:** Close, monitor humidity

From [NFT system guides](https://atlas-scientific.com/blog/nft-system-hydroponics/) and [DWC temperature research](https://agradehydroponics.com/blogs/water-control/dwc-water-temp-the-key-to-successful-hydroponic-growing), optimal water temp is 18-22°C for lettuce/herbs.

## 🏗️ **Production Systems - NFT vs DWC**

### **NFT (Nutrient Film Technique) - Your Primary System**

**What You Said:** *"I want to scale to NFT with food-grade PVC pipes with connections"*

**Specifications (from [technical research](https://easyhomehydroponics.com/diy-hydroponic-systems/assembling-a-diy-nutrient-film-technique-system-in-pvc-pipes/)):**
- **Pipe Diameter:** 3-4 inches (75-100mm) food-grade PVC
- **Slope:** 1:30 to 1:40 ratio (gentle decline)
- **Plant Spacing:** 8 inches (20cm) on center
- **Flow Rate:** Thin film, not submerged roots
- **UV-Resistant:** If exposed to sunlight

**Best For:**
- ✅ Rosso lettuce (flagship product)
- ✅ Arugula (fast turnover)
- ✅ Leafy greens (shallow roots)

**NFT Layout (100m² greenhouse):**
```
12 rows × 6 meters long = 72 meters of pipe
Plant spacing: 8 inches = 360 plants per cycle
Harvest cycle: 40 days
Annual capacity: 3,285 plants/year
Revenue: €10/kg × 0.25kg avg × 3,285 = €8,212/year per 100m²
```

**Sensor Strategy for NFT:**
- 1 sensor per 2 rows (6 sensors total per 100m²)
- Monitor: pH, EC, water temp, flow rate
- **Redundancy:** 2 sensors per greenhouse (1 good, 1 medium)

---

### **DWC (Deep Water Culture) - Herbs & Tomatoes**

**What You Said:** *"I'll produce DWC with some other culture"*

**Specifications (from [DWC lettuce guides](https://cultivatedearth.com/en/lettuce/DWC-lettuce/)):**
- **Water Temp:** 18-22°C (65-72°F) for lettuce/herbs
- **Air Pump:** Continuous oxygenation (critical!)
- **Reservoir Size:** 20-40 liters per plant (tomatoes) or 5-10L (herbs)
- **Light:** 12-16 hours/day

**Best For:**
- ✅ Basil (highest margin)
- ✅ Mint (bar demand)
- ✅ Cherry tomatoes (summer)
- ✅ Herbs (need stable water)

**DWC Layout (50m² greenhouse):**
```
10 DWC buckets × 5 liters = 50 plants
OR
5 large reservoirs × 20 plants = 100 herbs
Harvest cycle: 25-30 days (basil)
Annual capacity: 1,200 basil plants/year
Revenue: €20/kg × 0.15kg avg × 1,200 = €3,600/year per 50m²
```

**Sensor Strategy for DWC:**
- 1 sensor per reservoir (good quality)
- Monitor: Water temp, pH, EC, dissolved oxygen
- **Critical:** Water temp must stay 18-22°C (chiller needed in summer)

---

## 💰 **Revenue Model - LOCAL Algarve Focus**

### **Scenario: 150m² Greenhouse (100m² NFT + 50m² DWC)**

| Crop | System | Area | Annual Revenue | Margin |
|------|--------|------|----------------|--------|
| **Rosso Lettuce** | NFT | 60m² | €4,927 | 70% |
| **Arugula** | NFT | 40m² | €3,285 | 65% |
| **Basil** | DWC | 30m² | €2,160 | 80% |
| **Mint** | DWC | 20m² | €1,440 | 75% |
| **TOTAL** | | 150m² | **€11,812/year** | **72% avg** |

**But Wait - This is WHOLESALE Pricing!**

### **Direct-to-Restaurant Pricing (50% of sales)**

Restaurants pay 40-60% more than markets:
- Rosso lettuce: €10/kg wholesale → €16/kg restaurant direct
- Basil: €20/kg wholesale → €32/kg restaurant direct

**Revised Revenue (50% direct, 50% markets):**
```
€11,812 (wholesale base)
+ €5,906 (50% premium for direct sales)
= €17,718/year from 150m²
```

**Monthly Cash Flow:** €1,476/month (after costs)

## 🔢 **Sensor Strategy - Hundreds of Sensors, Tiered Quality**

### **Your Requirement:** *"Hundreds of sensors, good/medium/cheap but always redundant"*

**3-Tier Sensor System:**

| Tier | Type | Accuracy | Cost | Use Case | Quantity |
|------|------|----------|------|----------|----------|
| **Good** | Industrial pH/EC | ±0.1 pH, ±0.01 EC | €150-300 | Reference sensors | 1 per greenhouse |
| **Medium** | Consumer grade | ±0.2 pH, ±0.05 EC | €50-100 | Daily monitoring | 2-3 per greenhouse |
| **Cheap** | Arduino analog | ±0.5 pH, ±0.1 EC | €10-20 | Redundancy check | 5-10 per greenhouse |

### **Redundancy Strategy:**

**Per 100m² NFT Greenhouse:**
- **1 Good sensor** (reference, calibrated monthly)
- **3 Medium sensors** (daily use, compare to reference)
- **6 Cheap sensors** (detect anomalies, trigger alerts)
- **Total:** 10 sensors per greenhouse

**For 600m² operation (Phase 3):**
- 6 greenhouses × 10 sensors = **60 total sensors**

### **Drift Detection Logic:**

```python
# Multi-tier validation
good_sensor_ph = 6.2    # Reference
medium_1_ph = 6.3       # Within ±0.2 tolerance ✅
medium_2_ph = 6.1       # Within ±0.2 tolerance ✅
cheap_1_ph = 6.8        # Outside ±0.5 tolerance ⚠️

# Trigger alert to BUSINESS_PRIVATE channel:
"Cheap sensor #1 drifting - needs calibration"
"Revenue risk: €50/day if pH goes uncorrected"
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Good sensor = truth:** Calibrate monthly, trust it
- **Medium sensors = daily ops:** Compare to truth, use for decisions
- **Cheap sensors = early warning:** Detect gross failures, redundancy

---

## 📈 **Business Intelligence - LOCAL Market Data**

### **What to Track (for Data Marketplace later):**

1. **Crop Performance by Weather:**
   - "Rosso lettuce yields drop 15% when outside temp >32°C for 3+ days"
   - "Basil aroma intensity increases 20% when night temp <18°C"

2. **Local Market Pricing:**
   - "Loulé Market premium peaks at 45% during tourist season (Jul-Aug)"
   - "Restaurant direct sales 60% higher margin than market sales"

3. **Seasonal Demand:**
   - "Mint demand triples Jun-Aug (cocktail season)"
   - "Arugula demand drops 30% in summer (tourists want tomatoes)"

4. **Microclimates:**
   - "Greenhouse near Albufeira 2°C warmer than Loulé (coastal effect)"
   - "Best location for year-round production: Tavira (sheltered valley)"

**Future Revenue:** Sell this data to other Algarve farmers (€500-1,000 per report)

---

## ✅ **Success Metrics - BUSINESS DRIVEN**

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Revenue per m²** | €100/year minimum | Total revenue / greenhouse area |
| **Restaurant retention** | 80%+ | Clients ordering for 6+ months |
| **Waste rate** | <10% | Unsold produce / total harvest |
| **Profit margin** | 60%+ | (Revenue - costs) / revenue |
| **Sensor uptime** | 98%+ | Hours online / total hours |
| **Customer satisfaction** | 9/10+ | Survey restaurants monthly |

---

## 🚫 **What NOT to Do**

❌ **Don't chase global trends** (microgreens, exotic herbs) - focus on LOCAL demand
❌ **Don't compete on price** - compete on freshness + quality
❌ **Don't oversupply markets** - better to have waiting list than waste
❌ **Don't skimp on sensors** - losing €500 crop costs more than €50 sensor
❌ **Don't ignore seasonality** - tourist season = 3x profit, plan for it
❌ **Don't expand too fast** - perfect 150m² > mediocre 600m²
